# The Course
**This GitHub repository contains all of the learning material for the Introduction to Data Science for Geologists (DS4GEO) course at the University of Innsbruck (https://lfuonline.uibk.ac.at/public/lfuonline_lv.details?sem_id_in=20W&lvnr_id_in=715908). Teaching for the 2020 Winter Semeter is complete. The repository includes the notes/notebooks and overview of the course as it was taught following restructuring throughout the 2nd half of the course. The notebooks are provided exactly as they were for the classes and will eventually be archived and replace/updated when the course is next taught.**

The course was run for the first time in Winter Semester 2020 and is taught by Dr Samuel Barrett (samuel.barrett(at)uibk.ac.at).

The course is a mix of short lectures, practical workshops and discussion. It will take place on Wednesday afternoons at 15:30 until ca. 17:45, between 07/10/2020 and 9/12/2020 inclusive (10 sessions) in the Geology Institute Schausammlung. Bring a laptop!
